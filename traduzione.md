## What's steghold?

### How was born

Steghold was born to allow artists to gain control over their own music and career and allow fans to actively engage in the growth and development of their own favorite artists, through an NFT social marketplace.

### Key points and objectives

* Artists independence
* App to sell and buy NFTs
* Fans become investors
* Concerts and events in the metaverse

Everything integrated into a user-friendly ecosystem.

### Community-based

Our community will be a cornerstone of the project. We take what we do very seriously and that's why we will give you continuous updates.

## Why Algorand?

We choose the Algorand blockchain because:

* It's renowned for its safety, speed and reliability
* It's meant to be used for DeFi services
* Transactions' costs are very low
* More than 1000 transactions per second are guaranteed
* Being carbon-neutral, it protects the environment
* It was created by an Italian

This makes it the ideal solution to base the steghold infrastructure on.
